They say great things come in small packages&#8230; this charming corner-lot home is bursting with pride of ownership and offers so much more than you might expect in a home of this size. We welcome you to 200 Adlena Drive, located in the family friendly &#8216;West Lower Muck&#8217; neighborhood, just a few steps from Adlena Park. Upon arriving you&#8217;ll notice a stylish California native inspired landscape that compliments the front porch perfectly. Step inside to a completely upgraded interior; dual paned windows, distressed hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, central heating and air and double French doors to the backyard, just to name a few. The kitchen has been completely remodeled with granite counters, dark stained cabinetry, s.s. appliances and a designer glass tile backsplash. The original one car garage was converted, with permits, to living space in 1976 and is now the perfect dining room offering vaulted beamed ceilings, a skylight and additional pantry cupboards. A full size inside laundry room completes this area of the home with extra cabinetry. The bedrooms are comfortably sized with upgraded finishes and designer paint colors. A fully upgraded bathroom with great use of subway tile, glass mosaic tile and charming vintage designed tile floors. Outdoor living will be a pleasure in the expansive and private backyard. The highlight is the custom built BBQ island with bar and dual umbrella stands. 2-car detached garage with gated driveway plus another driveway.
